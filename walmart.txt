An analysis conducted by Puget Sound Sage in 2012, a nonprofit public policy organization that looks at regional economic issues, asserts that each new Walmart store decreases the local community’s economic output over 20 years by an estimated $13 million. The research also discovered that each Walmart store costs the community an additional $14 million in lost wages over the next 20 years. Though the Puget Sound Sage study was conducted years ago, research continues to reveal how Walmart affects the economy when it comes to town. The New York Times reported in 2019 that Walmart pleaded guilty to a series of bribes spanning more than a decade. In the case, individuals acting on behalf of Walmart were accused of bribing local officials to gain access to their regions for Walmart stores and obtain the necessary permits quickly. Here’s a deeper dive into how Walmart affects the economy and the small businesses pushed aside in its wake. What does a ‘Walmart economy’ mean? Walmart impacts the economy in positive and negative ways. It’s no secret that the retail giant offers low-cost products to U.S. consumers. A so-called “Walmart economy” allows people to buy the products they need at reasonable prices without overspending at higher-priced retailers. Reduced-price products are hugely beneficial to many people. When consumers spend less on essentials such as household items, they can put that money back into the economy with nonessential expenditures, such as a dinner out or a movie. But a Walmart economy has a darker side where small businesses pay the price.
